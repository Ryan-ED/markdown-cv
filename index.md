`Jan 2019 - Dec 2019`
__Software Developer Apprentice__, Kaleidocode, Durban  
This began with a rigorous training program with the aim of becoming skilled in writing automated UI test frameworks for enterprise web applications. This involved working with technologies like Apache, Maven and Jenkins.  
Shortly after completing that training I was moved to a more programming-focused role where I worked on building medium sized C#.NET web application.  
This was a very independent role as I was one of only two developers working on this project. I worked on the entire stack from database to presentation.  
After good performance on my previous work assignment, I was then moved to a larger, more established project and team where I was responsible for maintaining and upgrading an enterprise C#.NET web application.  
Adding new features and modules as well as updating and refactoring existing ones.
This role also involved a rapid ramp up in learning the Polymer front end framework. Having only a few weeks to become proficient.</p>
