<p>My ultimate goal is to improve on my craft each day, with each project, at every company I work for.</p>

## Experience

`Jan 2020 - Oct 2020`
__Cloud Support Associate__, Amazon Web Services, Cape Town

<p>Entered and completed the AWS Cloud Support Graduate program.</p>
<p>AWS Cloud Support provides global technical support to a wide range of external customers as they build mission-critical applications on top of AWS services such as Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2.</p>
<p>On a daily basis, we have to:

    <li>Apply advanced troubleshooting techniques to provide unique solutions to our customers' individual needs</li>
    <li>Interact with leading technologists around the world and resolve customer issues</li>
    <li>Work on critical, highly complex customer problems that may span multiple AWS services</li>
    <li>Drive customer communication during critical events</li>

</p>



`Jan 2019 - Dec 2019`
__Software Developer Apprentice__, Kaleidocode, Durban 
<p>This began with a rigorous training program with the aim of becoming skilled in writing automated UI test frameworks for enterprise web applications. This involved working with technologies like Apache, Maven and Jenkins.</p>
<p>Shortly after completing that training I was moved to a more programming-focused role where I worked on building medium sized C#.NET web application. This was a very independent role as I was one of only two developers working on this project. I worked on the entire stack from database to presentation.</p>
<p>After good performance on my previous work assignment, I was then moved to a larger, more established project and team where I was responsible for maintaining and upgrading an enterprise C#.NET web application. Adding new features and modules as well as updating and refactoring existing ones.
This role also involved a rapid ramp up in learning the Polymer front end framework. Having only a few weeks to become proficient.</p>
